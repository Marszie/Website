        Two Steps Ahead.
   </a>
   <br>
   <p>Two steps ahead. I am always two steps ahead. This has been the greatest social experiment of my entire life. It's alluring, it's compelling, it's gripping to observe all these unwell, disoriented beings roam the internet in search of stories, ideas, rivalries, where they feel encouraged and engaged, where they involve themselves with the stories and become a product of influence. Thirsty for distraction from time unspent, spoiling their minds yet stimulating them at the same time. It's brilliant, and it's dangerous. I feel as if I'm monitoring ants on an ant farm. One follows another, follows another, follows another, follows another. It's mesmerizing. It's spellbinding. All these little consumers, all of these lost – and bored – people. People consuming anything that they're told to consume. So, I am the villain because I've made myself one. And you will continue to consume these stories about me, year after year after year, for as long as I tell the internet that I am the villain. Stories that permeate and linger and infect the minds of the ants. Influence the ants, brainwash the ants, you are the ants. Today I woke up from a very long dream, and I also woke up having lost 250 pounds off of my body. Yet just yesterday, people were calling me fat, and sick, and boring, and irrelevant. People. People the most messed up creatures on the entire planet, and yet I've still managed to stay two steps ahead. Of everyone. The joke's on you. </p>
